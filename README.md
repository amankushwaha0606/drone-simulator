## Features

### 1. Multiple Drone Simulation

Simulate the movements of multiple drones simultaneously on the map.

### 2. Customizable Color Drone Paths

Choose different colors for each drone's path to distinguish them easily.

### 3. Upload Drone Data

You can upload drone data using two methods:
- Upload a JSON file.
- Manually enter latitude, longitude, and time in a comma-separated format.

### 4. Pause and Resume Simulation

Control the simulation by pausing and resuming individual drones.

### 5. Locate Drones

Quickly locate a specific drone on the map by clicking on its icon.

### 6. Optional Markers

Choose whether or not to display markers along the drone paths for better visualization.

### 7. Sample File

Download a sample JSON file (`sample-drone.json`) for reference.
